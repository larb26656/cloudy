description: Guide for choosing the right tool when working with ideas. Use this skill when creating, editing, deleting, listing, or updating ideas — to know whether to use the custom idea tools (idea-list, idea-create, idea-update, idea-delete) or standard tools (edit, write, read, bash). Also enforces that bash must NEVER be used to modify files — always prefer edit/write tools instead.

## Idea Tools vs Standard Tools

This project has a dedicated idea management system. Each idea lives as a folder with an `index.md` file generated from metadata. Understanding which tool to use prevents data corruption and keeps metadata in sync.

## Custom Idea Tools

These are registered as custom tools via the OpenCode plugin. They communicate with the Cloudy API server.

| Tool | When to use | What it does |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `idea-list` | "show me ideas", "find ideas about X", "what ideas are in-progress?" | Lists ideas with optional filters (query, status, priority, tags) |
| `idea-create` | "create a new idea", "I have an idea for...", "add idea" | Creates idea via API, generates folder + `index.md` automatically |
| `idea-update` | "mark idea as done", "change priority", "rename idea", "add tags" | Updates metadata (title, status, priority, tags) by idea path |
| `idea-delete` | "delete idea", "remove this idea" | Permanently deletes idea folder and all files |

## Standard Tools

Use these for idea **content** (not metadata):

| Tool | When to use | What it does |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `read` | Read idea content files (`notes.md`, code snippets, etc.) | Safe — read-only |
| `edit` | Edit idea content files (NOT `index.md`) | Modifies content, auto-touches idea timestamp |
| `write` | Create new files inside an idea folder (NOT `index.md`) | Creates files, auto-touches idea timestamp |

## Decision Flowchart

```
What do you want to do with an idea?
│
├─ List / search ideas → idea-list
│
├─ Create a new idea → idea-create
│   (don't mkdir or write files manually)
│
├─ Change metadata (title/status/priority/tags) → idea-update
│   (don't edit index.md directly — it's auto-generated)
│
├─ Delete an idea → idea-delete
│   (don't rm -rf the folder)
│
├─ Read idea content → read tool
│
├─ Edit idea content files (notes, code, etc.) → edit tool
│
├─ Create a new file inside an idea → write tool
│
└─ Anything else with bash → see below
```

## Protected: `index.md`

Every idea folder has an `index.md` file generated from metadata. This file is **protected**:

- **NEVER** edit `index.md` with the `edit` tool — it will be rejected
- **NEVER** overwrite `index.md` with the `write` tool — it will be rejected
- **NEVER** delete or move idea files via `bash` — destructive commands on the idea directory are blocked
- To change what appears in `index.md`, use `idea-update` to change the idea's metadata

## Bash Restrictions for Ideas

The plugin hard-blocks these bash commands when they target the idea directory:

- `rm`, `mv`, `cp`, `rmdir`, `chmod`, `chown`, `ln`

Reading commands like `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `find` on the idea directory are allowed.

## Bash Restrictions for ALL Files

Even outside ideas, bash should NOT be used to modify files. These patterns are wrong:

| Instead of this | Use this |
|-----------------|----------|
| `sed -i 's/old/new/' file` | `edit` tool |
| `echo "content" > file` | `write` tool |
| `cat <<EOF > file` | `write` tool |
| `printf "content" >> file` | `edit` tool |
| `tee file` | `write` tool |

Bash is for: `git`, `npm`, `bun`, `docker`, `make`, `tsc`, `biome`, `pytest`, `bun test`, `ls`, `grep`, `find`, `gh`, etc.
